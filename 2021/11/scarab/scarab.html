        ScarabNFT is a collection of 10,000 algorithmically generated NFT tokens created on Hathor Network. Despite the fact that the sale of ScarabNFTs is a step towards the full-scale ScarabGame development, ScarabNFTs are not just random images, but rather a trace of being previously involved in the Scarab ecosystem, since ScarabNFTs can be used on their own in a number of ways:

        Winning a Community Giveaway: each ScarabNFT holder will get a community giveaway of a certain value based on the number of ScarabNFT in the holder’s wallet. 1 NFT = 1 giveaway, 2 NFT = 2giveaways, 3 NFT = 3 giveaways and so on. In addition, the holders of more than 10 and 100 NFT will receive extra rewards. We believe that early adopters and the long-term supporters of the project should always be rewarded.

            </h3>
            <p>
                several scarabs will be drawn completely by hand in a certain distinctive style. They will be extremely rare, since there will be no more than 10 images of them. Each scarab will have its own name, making it even more unique and worth collecting. Several of them will be given away to the community members during our promo campaign. You can find more information about it below. The rest of the Scarabs will be available for purchase among all other NFTs, so the chances of obtaining such a Scarab are equal for everyone. The lucky holders of custom scarabs will receive extra rewards in community giveaways.

        </span>
       At the moment, an approximate minting start date is 01/12/2021. We are working hard to prepare and check everything by this time. The work on the visual style of the main elements is finished. and now our artists are finishing work on Custom Scarabs. Then we plan to launch a test minting of several NFTs to make sure everything works fine before proceeding to the release.
